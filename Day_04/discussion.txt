1. Types - Numbers :
- typeof method 
- Helper Methods 
- Modulo and Power Operators
- Infinity and Negative Infinity
- Not a Number


==============
- typeof is a keyword in JS that allows us to check the type of a variable.
- we can perform artimetic Operations on numbers like +, -, *, /. 
- But we can not perform artimetic Operations on strings. 



============
Helper Methods:
- Math.round() -> 20.5 (21), 20.2(20)
- Math.floor() -> gives us the lower end of the number 20.2 (20)
- Math.ceil() -> gives us the upper end of the number 20.9 (21)
- Math.random() -> gives us a random number between 0 and 1

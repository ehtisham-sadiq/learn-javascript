// 1. What is inheritance in OOP?
// Inheritance is a mechanism in OOP that allows a new class to inherit properties and methods from an existing class.
// The existing class is called the parent class or superclass, and the new class is called the child class or subclass.
// The child class can access all the public and protected properties and methods of the parent class.
// The child class can also have its own properties and methods.
// Inheritance promotes code reusability and helps in creating a hierarchy of classes.

// Limitations of Inheritance:
// - Inheritance can lead to a complex hierarchy of classes.
// - Inheritance can create dependencies between classes.
// - Inheritance can lead to the diamond problem in multiple inheritance.
// - Inheritance can make the code harder to understand and maintain.
